# Frontend Architecture - Role-Based File Structure

## Overview
The frontend has been restructured to separate concerns by user role, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

## File Structure

## JavaScript Architecture

### Core Module (`dashboard-core.js`)
- **Purpose**: Common functionality shared by all roles
- **Contains**:
  - Authentication logic
  - Profile management
  - Base Vue application setup
  - Common utility methods
  - Role checking methods
  - Tab navigation
  - Base dashboard data loading

### Role-Specific Modules

#### Admin Module (`roles/admin.js`)
- **Purpose**: Admin-only functionality
- **Contains**:
  - User management (CRUD operations)
  - Assignment management 
  - System statistics
  - Admin dashboard data loading
  - User filtering and searching

#### Coach Module (`roles/coach.js`)
- **Purpose**: Coach-specific functionality  
- **Contains**:
  - Archer assignment management
  - Session management
  - Performance tracking
  - Coach dashboard data loading
  - Archer reassignment functionality

#### Archer Module (`roles/archer.js`)
- **Purpose**: Archer-specific functionality
- **Contains**:
  - Personal performance tracking
  - Score management
  - Session booking/cancellation
  - Achievement system
  - Coach information display

### Main Application (`dashboard-main.js`)
- **Purpose**: Combines all modules and initializes the Vue app
- **Contains**:
  - Module composition using Vue mixins
  - Application mounting
  - Role-specific data loading orchestration

## CSS Architecture

### Base Styles (`dashboard-base.css`)
- **Purpose**: Common styles used by all roles
- **Contains**:
  - Layout and grid systems
  - Typography
  - Form elements
  - Buttons and interactions
  - Modal components
  - Responsive design base

### Role-Specific Styles

#### Admin Styles (`roles/admin.css`)
- **Contains**:
  - User management interface styles
  - Admin color scheme (#ff6b6b - red)
  - Assignment management layouts
  - Modal forms for user creation/editing
  - Filtering interfaces

#### Coach Styles (`roles/coach.css`)
- **Contains**:
  - Archer management card layouts
  - Coach color scheme (#4834d4 - purple)
  - Session management interfaces
  - Performance indicator styles
  - Assignment action layouts

#### Archer Styles (`roles/archer.css`)
- **Contains**:
  - Performance dashboard layouts
  - Archer color scheme (#00d2d3 - teal)
  - Score tracking interfaces
  - Achievement system styling
  - Personal progress indicators

## Benefits of This Structure

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each role's code is isolated and easy to locate
- Changes to one role don't affect others
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new roles or modify existing ones
- Modular structure allows for independent development
- Reduced file sizes and better loading performance

### 3. **Code Organization**
- Related functionality is grouped together
- Easier code review and debugging
- Better team collaboration (different developers can work on different roles)

### 4. **Performance**
- Smaller, focused files load faster
- Future possibility for role-based lazy loading
- Reduced bundle size for role-specific builds

### 5. **Testing**
- Each module can be tested independently
- Role-specific functionality is isolated
- Easier to write unit tests for specific features

## Loading Order
The files are loaded in this specific order to ensure dependencies are met:

1. **Vue.js library** (from CDN)
2. **CSS files** (base styles first, then role-specific)
3. **Core JavaScript** (`dashboard-core.js`)
4. **Role modules** (`admin.js`, `coach.js`, `archer.js`)
5. **Main application** (`dashboard-main.js`)

## Migration Notes

### Migration Complete ✅
The original monolithic files have been successfully removed:
- ~~`css/dashboard.css`~~ - **REMOVED**
- ~~`js/dashboard.js`~~ - **REMOVED**

The new modular structure is now the only implementation, ensuring:
1. ✅ All functionality works with the new structure
2. ✅ All role-specific features are properly separated
3. ✅ No missing dependencies or loading issues
4. ✅ Responsive design works across all roles
5. ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Lazy Loading**: Load role-specific modules only when needed
2. **Build System**: Use webpack/vite to bundle and optimize files
3. **TypeScript**: Add type safety to the JavaScript modules
4. **Component-Based**: Convert to Vue Single File Components
5. **State Management**: Implement Vuex/Pinia for complex state management

### Role Extension
To add a new role:
1. Create `roles/newrole.js` with role-specific functionality
2. Create `roles/newrole.css` with role-specific styles
3. Add loading script tags to `dashboard.html`
4. Update `dashboard-main.js` to include the new module
5. Add role checking logic in `dashboard-core.js`

This modular structure provides a solid foundation for scaling the application and maintaining clean, organized code.
